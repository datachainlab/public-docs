# Introduction

## What is Fabric-IBC?

Fabric-IBC provides a means for Hyperledger Fabric to communicate with other distributed ledgers without the need for a trusted third party. Fabric-IBC is based on Cosmos' ICS, specifications for Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), and enables communication between blockchains, distributed ledgers, and other systems that support ICS.

Fabric-IBC provides an implementation of the Fabric-IBC Module that can be used with chaincode.
